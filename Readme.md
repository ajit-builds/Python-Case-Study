# ✈️ Airline Seating Heatmap Generator

A Python-based airline seating visualization system that generates heatmaps and trend analysis from passenger seating data. The project uses object-oriented programming, CSV/JSON datasets, and Matplotlib, and is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the web app:
https://python-case-study-dgsz24aschpdappnkcpa5c.streamlit.app
📊 How It Works

Aircraft layout is loaded from layout.json

Seating data is loaded from seating.csv

Seat occupancy is mapped to a 2D grid

Heatmap and trend charts are generated using Matplotlib

Results are displayed interactively in the browser

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was built to practice Python OOP concepts, work with real-world structured datasets, learn data visualization techniques, understand modular system design, and deploy Python applications as web apps.

🌱 Future Improvements

CSV upload from browser

Seat legend UI

Downloadable heatmap images

Support for more aircraft models

Dark mode UI
